# GPT 4 grid extraction

## Question

Can gpt4 vision perfectly extract the x y positions of objects on a grid? Lets see. 

## Plan
- generate random grid and image of it
- send image to gpt 4 vision
- compare the two grids

## Notes
GPT kept refusing to be able to do this for a bit. 

Currently seems to get confused on where to start counting.
